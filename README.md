# Express Access Demo - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) API

Welcome to the Express Access Demo project! This repository demonstrates how to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in a Node.js API using the express-access library. This project shows how to protect API routes so that only specific users with appropriate roles (like admins or editors) can access them.

## 🎯 What is RBAC?

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to resources based on user roles. For example, an admin might have full access to delete posts, while a regular user can only read them. The express-access library makes implementing RBAC straightforward and elegant, and it's database-agnostic, making it compatible with any backend setup.

## 📦 Library Used

This project uses [express-access](https://github.com/bahador-r/express-access) (v1.4.1), a powerful middleware for Express.js that provides:

- Simple and flexible role-based access control
- Database-agnostic design
- Easy integration with existing Express applications
- Support for multiple roles per user
- Granular permission control
- Middleware-based implementation

## 🚀 Features

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation
- Multiple user roles (Admin, Editor, Reader)
- Protected API endpoints
- Easy to integrate with any database
- Express.js based API

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/express-access-demo.git
cd express-access-demo
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

The server will start running on port 3000.

## 🔑 API Endpoints

The API includes the following protected endpoints:

- `GET /api/posts` - View all posts (accessible by all roles)
- `POST /api/posts` - Create a new post (requires Editor or Admin role)
- `PUT /api/posts/:id` - Update a post (requires Editor or Admin role)
- `DELETE /api/posts/:id` - Delete a post (requires Admin role)

## 🧪 Testing

You can test the API using the provided Postman collection:
1. Import `express-access-demo.postman_collection.json` into Postman
2. Use the different role-based requests to test the RBAC functionality

## 📚 Dependencies

- express: ^4.18.2
- express-access: ^1.4.1
